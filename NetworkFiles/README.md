All networks with DICT at the end can be loaded directly onto a torch neural network, that is set to run on a CPU device (see here:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html)

Otherwise, unless noted, all neural networks have been set to run on a CUDA device. See the "load GPU Network" function in Training.py if you need to load these networks for use on a CPU device.

Not all networks were saved during the evaluation due to certain errors.
