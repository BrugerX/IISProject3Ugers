Contains the units used in the calculation and the actual Excel calculation file.

The calculation was done Sunday, but the HPCs which were used to train the network were not available until Monday 07:00, therefore I had a maximum of approx. A day, as I needed time to analyze the results as well.

The constant is based on the time_csv files, one of which I have appended to this repository. The result were approx. the same for all 5 action space sizes and DQN_type methods.
