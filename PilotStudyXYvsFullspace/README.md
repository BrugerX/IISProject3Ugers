Description of this folder:

In order to decide whether to use the full board space (FullSpace) or simply the location of the agent (XY), I decided to conduct a pilot study.
These are the scripts containing the QModels and the actual script for doing the study.

NOTE:

In order to recreate the pilot study, you must fulfill the same conditions as in the main main.py and Qmodels.py scripts.
