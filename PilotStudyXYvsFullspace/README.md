Description of this folder:

In order to decide whether to use the full board space (FullSpace) or simply the location of the agent (XY), I decided to conduct a pilot study.
These are the scripts containing the QModels and the actual script for doing the study.

The result can be viewed in the .out file, which contains the print statements of the main script.

NOTE:

In order to recreate the pilot study, you must fulfill the same conditions as in the main main.py and Qmodels.py scripts.
